## Nosferatu Upon Type Single Review by Darryn Baser music.net.nz

Being an OG (old goth or original goth) from the 1980's I love me a bit of goth. Stars and the Underground are a nice bit of goth who have just released a single.

It’s a seldom admitted bit of folklore that many goths have a great sense of humour, it seems the members of Stars and the Underground have a lighter side of the dark side. I come to this conclusion from the title of their single; Nosferatu Upon Tyne.

Referencing a northern English city shows homage to the Sisters of Mercy who hail from Leeds, but to put it into a pun on the city, in my opinion shows a modicum of humour.

The ‘a’ side has a classic late 80's goth sound, from the PCM (pitch code modulation) synth string melody which begins, before ‘chorus’ effected guitar chords continue.

Singer-guitarist John Mason’s voice reminds me of a cross between Andrew Eldritch and Carl McCoy.

Then there’s the other ‘a’ side, the Robots In Love remix (complete reworking) by Dunedin-based Darkwave genius Elenor Rayner. She takes the song by the throat, shakes it around, and puts the pieces back together in her own distinctive, and brilliant, style.

Rating: ☆☆☆☆☆ ( 4 / 5 )



## Drab Majesty DJ Passion Crypt, 27th January 2019, Whammy! Back Room, Auckland, New Zealand
The humidity of the Summer season was at an all me high but that was not going to stop fans attending the sold out Drab Majesty show at Whammy Backroom, ancipaon levels peaking as they ﬁled through the doors to watch local support act Stars and the Underground strut their stuﬀ before the dark duo of Deb Demure and Mona D descended in all their tragic wave glory.

Formed by John Mason who many would have recognised from the band Winterland, Stars and the Underground are a solo project, however Auckland fans were treated to a more rounded live producon with the addition of both one half of Hieronymus Bosch in the form of Mark Wallbank and the thrown shapes and masterful sound-making of Sean O’Kane Connolly from dark ambient project Undiscovered Moons of Saturn. The set began, and the audience was immediately drawn in, each of the members sonically moving together as one in the darkened and somewhat stiffling room.

But comfort levels were soon forgotten as Stars and the Underground moved into their second track of the evening, ‘Twilight By Design’ of which the video single it is worth noting was produced and directed by Mark Wallbank a combination of Cure style bass notes overlaid with rousing electric guitar highlights that descended into an instrumental soundscape complimented by Mason’s vocals and easily memorable chorus.

Moving through the set that combined facets of goth, shoe gaze and dark electronic music with vocals from Mason intermingly added in just the right places – the instrumental element of Stars and the Underground oen communicating all that needed to be said – fans were treated to tracks such as ‘The Sun and Moon and Stars’ as well as ‘Ghost in the Trees’. Throwing in a cover of Winterland’s ‘Memory of You’, Stars and the Underground proved itself to be a worthy live act…
